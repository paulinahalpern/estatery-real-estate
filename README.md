A modern and responsive real estate landing page built with React, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, and React Router, based on a Figma design.

JavaScript – Core scripting

CSS – Styling and layout

React Router – Client-side routing

Figma – UI/UX design reference

css modules
css variables
react
vercel deployment
react router

What I will do better next week:
