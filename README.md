Project purpose:
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a scalable, modular front-end structure for a real estate platform. It's meant to serve as a starting point for future features such as property listings, rental guides, or application help tools.
The project was build based on Figma file https://www.figma.com/community/file/1159150161670385658/free-estatery-real-estate-saas-web-and-mobile-ui-kit.
Project link: https://real-estate-design-cwgb.vercel.app/

Core Technologies & Features:
- React – Built with functional components.
- React Router - Enables navigation.
- CSS Modules – Provides scoped styling and promotes better structure and organization by keeping styles unique and local to each component.
- CSS Variables - Used for consistency across the app, and for more readable and maintainable styles.
- Responsive Design – Mobile-friendly layout using Flexbox/Grid.
- Vercel Deployment - Simplifies hosting and continuous deployment with automatic updates on every push.
- TypeScript - A version of JavaScript that allows adding types to variables and functions, which helps prevent bugs and improves code readability.
  extends – Used to create reusable and consistent prop types by extending base interfaces across components.
- React Developer Tools (Chrome) – Used to inspect component hierarchies, props, and state during development for easier debugging and optimization.
- Figma – Used for UI/UX design reference.
  

What I will do better next week:
- Better planning of styling with Grid and FlexBox
