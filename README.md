Project purpose:
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a scalable, modular front-end structure for a real estate platform.

Core Technologies & Features:
- React – Built with functional components.
- React Router - Enables navigation.
- CSS Modules – Provides scoped styling and promotes better structure and organization by keeping styles unique and local to each component.
- CSS Variables - Used for consistency across the app, and for more readable and maintainable styles.
- Responsive Design – Mobile-friendly layout using Flexbox/Grid.
- Vercel Deployment - Deployed with automatic updates on code push.
- TypeScript – Adds static typing for more reliable and maintainable code.
  Used extends to define reusable prop types via base interfaces.
- React Developer Tools (Chrome) – Used to inspect component hierarchies, props, and state during development for easier debugging and optimization.
- Figma – UI/UX design reference for layout and styling consistency.
  

What I will do better next week:
- More structured planning for layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox combinations
